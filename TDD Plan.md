# TDD Plan: Walmart DC 8980 Shipping Department PWA

## Test-Driven Development Strategy

We will follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure robust, maintainable code for the Walmart DC 8980 Shipping Department PWA. For each feature, we will adhere to the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the desired behavior
2. **Green**: Write code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Optimize the code while ensuring tests still pass

## Testing Approach by Feature

### Door Schedule Management

#### Unit Tests
- Validate door numbers within range (332-454)
- Ensure correct destination DC selection (6024, 6070, 6039, 6040, 7045)
- Verify freight type options (23/43, 28, XD)
- Confirm trailer status options (partial, empty, shipload)

#### Integration Tests
- Test the form submission process
- Verify state updates when form fields change
- Ensure data persistence works correctly

### Pallet Counter

#### Unit Tests
- Verify increment functionality increases count by 1
- Verify decrement functionality decreases count by 1
- Ensure count cannot go below 0

#### Integration Tests
- Test counter interactions within the door schedule context
- Verify total pallet counts update correctly

### Data Export

#### Unit Tests
- Test CSV string generation from data model
- Verify all required fields are included in export
- Test filename generation with correct date format

#### Integration Tests
- Test the export button triggers correct download behavior
- Verify exported data matches application state

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: Primary testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For component and UI testing
- **Mock Service Worker**: For simulating API calls if needed

## Benefits of Our TDD Approach

1. **Focus on Requirements**: Writing tests first ensures we build exactly what's needed
2. **Early Error Detection**: Problems are caught during development, not in production
3. **Improved Design**: TDD encourages modular, loosely coupled code
4. **Built-in Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
5. **Regression Prevention**: Existing tests catch unintended side effects of new features

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up testing framework and environment
2. For each user story:
   - Write failing tests based on acceptance criteria
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactor while maintaining test coverage
3. Implement continuous integration to run tests on each commit

## Future Testing Considerations

As we expand the application in future phases, our test suite will grow to include:

- Offline functionality testing
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Accessibility testing
- End-to-end testing with tools like Cypress

By following this disciplined approach, we'll reduce debugging time and technical debt, while ensuring the application remains reliable as new features are added.
