# - Firebase Hosting
# - Any static hosting service

# 3. Verify HTTPS and PWA features work

# 3. Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android

# 4. Build APK/AAB in Android Studio
# - Connect device or use emulator
# - Build → Build Bundle(s)/APK(s) → Build APK(s)
```

### Option 3: iOS Mobile App (Requires macOS)

# 1. Build web assets  
npm run build

# 2. Add iOS platform (first time only)
npx cap add ios

# 3. Sync to iOS
npx cap sync ios

# 4. Open in Xcode
npx cap open ios

# 5. Build IPA in Xcode

# - Product → Archive → Distribute App
```

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Critical (Must Fix Before Production)
- [ ] Remove remaining console.log in errorHandling.ts:276,312
- [ ] Fix empty block statements in components
- [ ] Remove unused imports and variables

### Quality Improvements (Should Fix)
- [ ] Increase test coverage from 31% to 70%
- [ ] Fix remaining ESLint warnings
- [ ] Add error boundaries for voice features

### Performance (Nice to Have)
- [x] Bundle size optimization (completed)
- [ ] Lazy load routes
- [ ] Optimize images

## Environment Variables (None Required)
This app works entirely client-side with localStorage - no backend configuration needed.

## Deployment Commands

### Quick Web Deployment
```powershell
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to hosting service
```

### Full Mobile Build
```powershell
npm run build && npx cap sync && npx cap open android
```

## Testing Before Deployment
```powershell
npm test                    # Run test suite
npm run build              # Verify production build
npm run preview            # Test built app locally
```

## Final Status
**Ready for web PWA deployment with minor cleanup needed for mobile app stores.**

Main functionality tested and working:
- Door scheduling with validation
- Pallet tracking with timers
- Voice commands (Web Speech API)
- Data export (CSV/ZIP)
- Offline functionality
- PWA installation prompts
