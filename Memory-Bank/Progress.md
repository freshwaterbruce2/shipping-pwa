# Project Progress: Walmart DC 8980 Shipping Department PWA

## Project Health
**Status**: On track. Key objectives and deliverables are clearly defined and being tracked.

## Completed Milestones
- Requirements gathering completed
  - Door list specifications defined
  - Freight/trailer types documented
  - Pallet counting mechanism outlined
  - Revised prompt received with detailed UI/UX requirements and new data fields.
- Data Model Updated:
  - `DoorSchedule` type updated with new `TrailerStatus` codes (NT, E, 25%, 50%, 75%, SL).
  - `tcrPresent` field added and made required in `DoorSchedule`.
- Feature list compiled
- Initial architectural decisions made:
  - Mobile-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA)
  - Local data storage implementation (currently localStorage)
  - CSV export functionality
- User Interface implementation:
  - Basic Top Tab Navigation Structure implemented using React Router.
  - Placeholder components created for Scheduler, Pallet Counter, Notes, and Settings modules.
  - Voice control for door management (basic structure)
  - Responsive shipping table (initial version)
  - Animated UI elements
  - Mobile-optimized layout
  - Walmart brand-aligned styling
- Core functionality implemented:
  - Door assignment system
  - Pallet counter components
  - Voice command integration
  - Cross-browser CSV export capability

## Current Progress
**In Progress**:
- Setting up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Implementing automated tests for core functionality
- Conducting accessibility and performance audits
- Preparing for internal user testing

## Upcoming Tasks
- Create complete test suite following TDD approach
- Integrate Lighthouse for performance metrics
- Implement service worker for offline capabilities
- Establish user feedback collection mechanism

## Blockers and Risks
**Current Status**: No critical blockers identified

**Potential Risks**:
- Possible challenges with:
  - Service worker implementation on iOS devices
  - Voice recognition reliability in noisy environments
  - Data synchronization when offline

**Mitigation Strategy**: 
- Comprehensive cross-browser testing
- Environmental noise filtering for voice commands
- Robust data persistence with conflict resolution

## Next Steps
1. Complete Jest test implementation for CSV export
2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
3. Run accessibility audit with axe-core
4. Conduct performance testing with Lighthouse
5. Begin internal pilot with warehouse staff

## Reporting Approach
Maintaining a concise, clear summary of project progress, potential blockers, and upcoming steps to ensure transparent communication.
