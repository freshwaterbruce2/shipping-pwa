# Tech Context: Walmart DC 8980 Shipping Department PWA

## Technology Stack Overview

Based on requirements and future flexibility, we have chosen a modern web stack:

### Frontend Framework
We're using React with TypeScript to speed development with reusable components. This provides a responsive, SPA-like interface (no full page reloads) that can run in any browser, especially Safari on iPhone.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
The app is built as a PWA so it can be installed on the home screen, work offline, and leverage device features. A PWA built with web technologies provides a native-like experience on any platform from one codebase, requiring no App Store download and offering consistent UX. This aligns with being "future-forward" â€“ the same web app could later be published as a native app if needed.

### UI Components
We're leveraging the shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling. This provides:
- Accessible, responsive components
- Consistent design language
- Easy customization with Walmart brand colors

### Storage
For persistence, the app will primarily use IndexedDB (via a lightweight library or directly) because it handles structured data without blocking the main thread. Simple counts or small settings can use localStorage. IndexedDB is preferred for robustness in PWAs.

### Data Export
We generate CSV files client-side. CSV is ideal since it's widely used for data exchange and easy to open in Excel/Sheets. JavaScript assembles CSV strings and triggers a file download. Users get a file (e.g., shipping_schedule_[date].csv) with all door setups and counts.

### Build Tools
We're using Vite as our build tool to bundle code efficiently. All code is written in TypeScript for type safety and clarity.

### Testing
Jest for unit tests, plus React Testing Library for component testing, and potentially an end-to-end test tool (like Cypress) for the full workflow.

### Hosting
Initially, a static host (or internal web server) serving the app's files is sufficient. Because no backend is needed, any simple HTTP server or a local file can serve it. If needed, deploying to a cloud host or inside Walmart's network is feasible.

## Benefits of This Stack

This tech stack is cost-effective and allows future growth:

1. **Offline Capability**: By using web standards, the app "works offline and in the background" when needed
2. **Cost Efficiency**: PWAs are more cost-effective and have broader platform compatibility than native apps, minimizing overhead while maximizing reach
3. **Future Extensibility**: Building with components and a service worker ensures we can later add features (like push notifications or syncing) without redoing the foundation
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time checking to catch errors early
5. **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on various devices

## Future Considerations

- **Backend Integration**: If needed, the app could be connected to Walmart's backend systems for real-time data
- **Authentication**: User authentication could be added if access control becomes a requirement
- **Push Notifications**: Service workers could be used to enable push notifications for important updates
- **Offline Sync**: Implementation of offline data synchronization for when network connectivity is restored
