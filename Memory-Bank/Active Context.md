# Active Context: Testing and Optimization Phase

## Current Project Phase
The project is in the testing and optimization phase, focusing on improving test coverage, fixing test failures, and enhancing performance.

## Recent Updates
- Implemented comprehensive test suite
- Added accessibility testing with axe-core
- Set up performance testing with Lighthouse
- Created mock implementations for external dependencies
- Updated TypeScript configuration
- Enhanced test coverage reporting

## Testing Status
1. Unit Tests:
   - Core components tested
   - Data export functionality validated
   - User settings tests implemented
   - Voice command tests added
2. Integration Tests:
   - Door scheduling workflow
   - Pallet counting system
   - CSV export process
3. Accessibility Tests:
   - ARIA attributes verified
   - Keyboard navigation tested
   - Screen reader compatibility checked
4. Performance Tests:
   - Lighthouse metrics tracked
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Loading performance measured

## Current Challenges
1. Test Coverage:
   - Below target threshold (70%)
   - Missing component tests
   - Incomplete integration tests
2. Test Failures:
   - React Router deprecation warnings
   - Framer Motion module resolution
   - Mock implementation gaps
3. Performance:
   - Large dataset handling
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Caching implementation

## Next Actions
1. Fix Test Environment:
   - Update React Router configuration
   - Resolve Framer Motion dependencies
   - Enhance mock implementations
2. Increase Coverage:
   - Add missing component tests
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add end-to-end tests
3. Optimize Performance:
   - Implement code splitting
   - Reduce bundle size
   - Add caching strategies

## Technical Decisions
1. Testing Framework:
   - Jest for unit tests
   - React Testing Library for component tests
   - axe-core for accessibility
   - Lighthouse for performance
2. Mock Strategy:
   - Jest mocks for external dependencies
   - Custom mock implementations for complex components
   - Test data generators for large datasets
3. Performance Optimization:
   - Code splitting by route
   - Lazy loading for non-critical components
   - Service worker for offline support

## Documentation Updates
1. Testing Documentation:
   - Test coverage reports
   - Testing procedures
   - Mock implementations
2. Performance Documentation:
   - Lighthouse reports
   - Bundle analysis
   - Optimization strategies

## Resource Allocation
1. Testing:
   - Unit test development
   - Integration test implementation
   - Accessibility compliance
2. Performance:
   - Bundle optimization
   - Caching implementation
   - Loading performance
3. Documentation:
   - Testing guides
   - Performance reports
   - User documentation
