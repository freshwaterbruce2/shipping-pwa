    - Door numbers (valid range: 332-454)
    - Destination DC (options: 6024, 6070, 6039, 6040, 7045)
    - Freight type (options: 23/43, 28, XD)

- **Data Export**: One-click export of the complete setup data to CSV format or a ZIP archive containing multiple CSV files.
- **Installable PWA**: Works offline after the first load and can be installed on mobile devices and desktops for a native-like experience.
- **Settings Panel**: Configure voice recognition, interaction modes, and other preferences.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Getting Started

### Windows Development Environment

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Node.js (v18+ recommended) and npm
    *   A modern web browser (Chrome/Edge recommended for best Web Speech API support)

2.  **Setup Project**:
    ```powershell
    # Navigate to project directory
    cd C:\dev\projects\web-apps\shipping-pwa
    
    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Development Commands**:
    ```powershell
    # Start development server (port 5173)
    npm run dev
    
    # Run tests with coverage
    npm test
    
    # Run linting
    npm run lint
    
    # Build for production
    npm run build
    
    # Preview production build
    npm run preview
    ```

### Cross-Platform Deployment
```bash
# For server deployment
npm run build    # Creates dist/ directory for deployment
npm run preview  # Test production build locally
    ```
5.  **Open the application**:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in the output) in your browser.

## Build & Deploy

1.  **Build for production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or if using bun
    # bun run build
    ```
    This command bundles the application and outputs the static files to the `dist/` directory.
2.  **Preview the production build locally**:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    # or if using bun
    # bun run preview
    ```
3.  **Deploy**:
    *   Deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder to any static web hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, internal server).
    *   Ensure your hosting provider is configured for Single Page Applications (SPAs) by rewriting all navigation requests to `index.html`.
    *   Serve the application over HTTPS to enable PWA features like installation and service workers.

## Testing

1.  **Run unit tests**:
    ```bash
    npm test
    # or
    # npm run test:watch # To run in watch mode
    # or if using bun
    # bun test
    ```
    This executes the test suite using Jest.
2.  **Check test coverage**:
    ```bash
    npm run test:coverage
    # or if using bun
    # bun run test:coverage
    ```
    This generates a coverage report in the `coverage/` directory, showing which parts of the code are covered by tests. Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your browser to view the detailed report.
