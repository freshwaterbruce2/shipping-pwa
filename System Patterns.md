# System Patterns: Walmart DC 8980 Shipping Department PWA

## Architectural Design Patterns

To support maintainability and future expansion, we will use proven design patterns:

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
The app's data (Model: door assignments, pallet counts) will be separated from the UI (View) and input logic (Controller). MVC makes the codebase modular and easy to test or extend. For instance, changing the data storage or UI theme can be done independently.

### Component-Based Architecture
Each UI element (door entry row, counter, toolbar) will be a self-contained component. This reuse of components reduces development and testing time and improves reliability. It also allows adding features later (like an auto-count camera component) with minimal disruption.

### Repository/Facade Pattern (Data Layer)
We will abstract data access (e.g., localStorage or IndexedDB) behind a simple interface. This way, whether we store in localStorage now or switch to a cloud DB later, the rest of the app code remains unaffected.

### Singleton (App State)
A singleton store (or context) will hold shared state (current door list, total pallets) so all components can access it without prop-drilling.

### Event/Observer Pattern
For UI updates (e.g., when a pallet count changes), an event-driven approach keeps components in sync without tight coupling.

### Progressive Web App (PWA) Patterns
We'll incorporate a service worker and cache API for offline use. This pattern ensures fast performance and resilience. Static Jamstack/PWA sites simply serve pre-built HTML/JS, yielding high speed and security. A well-built Jamstack site presents a series of usable HTML files with significant advantages in performance and security.

## Implementation Benefits

These patterns together create a solid, modular architecture that can grow (e.g., adding authentication or a mobile app wrapper later) without rewriting core logic. Benefits include:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each part of the application has a clear responsibility
2. **Testability**: Isolated components and logic are easier to test
3. **Scalability**: The architecture supports adding new features without major refactoring
4. **Maintainability**: Code organization makes it easier for developers to understand and modify
5. **Resilience**: PWA patterns ensure the application works even with intermittent connectivity

## Pattern Application Examples

- **MVC**: Door schedule data (Model) is separate from the UI table (View) and the form controls (Controller)
- **Component**: The door row, pallet counter, and export button are all reusable components
- **Repository**: A ShippingDataService abstracts all localStorage/IndexedDB operations
- **Singleton**: A ShippingContext provides app-wide state access to all components
- **Event/Observer**: Components subscribe to data changes rather than being tightly coupled
- **PWA**: Service worker caches the application shell and critical data for offline use
