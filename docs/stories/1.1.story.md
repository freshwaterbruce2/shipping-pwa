## Story DoD Checklist Report

### Acceptance Criteria Assessment
- **AC1: Remove debug styling** ✅ DONE - Removed yellow/red debug styling from VoiceDoorControl
- **AC2: React Error Boundaries** ✅ DONE - Comprehensive ErrorBoundary component with fallback UI
- **AC3: Voice command tests** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Tests created but some failures need fixing (26.89% coverage)
- **AC4: Service layer extraction** ✅ DONE - ShippingService created with full CRUD operations
- **AC5: Performance optimizations** ✅ DONE - Debounce hooks and memory management utilities
- **AC6: Error handling patterns** ✅ DONE - Comprehensive error handling utilities with type safety

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript Usage** ✅ All new code uses proper TypeScript with strong typing
- **Component Architecture** ✅ Follows existing patterns and composition principles
- **Error Handling** ✅ Standardized error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Performance** ✅ Debouncing and memory leak prevention implemented

### Testing Status
- **New Tests Created** ✅ VoiceCommandButton and useVoiceCommand test suites
- **Test Coverage** ⚠️ 26.89% overall (below 70% target, needs improvement)
- **Test Failures** ⚠️ Some existing tests need updates for new components

### Breaking Changes Assessment
- **Backward Compatibility** ✅ All changes maintain existing API contracts
- **iPhone Compatibility** ✅ Previous iPhone optimizations preserved
- **Voice Command Functionality** ✅ Enhanced without breaking existing features

### Performance Impact
- **Debouncing** ✅ Voice command processing now debounced to prevent rapid-fire
- **Memory Management** ✅ Proper cleanup in hooks and components
- **Bundle Size** ✅ No significant increase in bundle size

### Security Considerations
- **Error Information Exposure** ✅ Production errors sanitized, dev errors detailed
- **Input Validation** ✅ ShippingService includes comprehensive validation
- **Permission Handling** ✅ Enhanced microphone permission error handling

### Recommendations for Next Sprint
1. **Fix Test Failures** - Address failing tests to improve coverage above 70%
2. **Integration Testing** - Add E2E tests for voice command workflows
3. **Service Layer Migration** - Gradually migrate existing components to use ShippingService
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Implement metrics for voice command response times
