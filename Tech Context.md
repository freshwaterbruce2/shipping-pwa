# Tech Context: Walmart DC 8980 Shipping Department PWA

## Technology Stack Overview

Based on requirements and future flexibility, we have chosen a modern web stack:

### Frontend Framework
We're using React with TypeScript to speed development with reusable components. This provides a responsive, SPA-like interface (no full page reloads) that can run in any browser, especially Safari on iPhone.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
The app is built as a PWA so it can be installed on the home screen, work offline, and leverage device features. A PWA built with web technologies provides a native-like experience on any platform from one codebase, requiring no App Store download and offering consistent UX.

### UI Components and Design System
We've implemented:
- Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom Walmart brand color tokens
- Consistent typography system for improved readability
- Universal picker drawer for efficient data entry
- Bottom sheet navigation pattern for mobile-friendly interaction

### Storage
For persistence, the app uses localStorage for storing door schedules and user preferences. We plan to upgrade to IndexedDB for more robust data management as the application grows.

### Data Export
We generate CSV files client-side. The export system provides a download of user data in a format compatible with Excel/Sheets and other analysis tools.

### Build Tools
We're using Vite as our build tool to bundle code efficiently. All code is written in TypeScript for type safety and clarity.

### Testing
Jest for unit tests, particularly focusing on the export functionality and voice command grammar.

### Performance Optimization
We're implementing:
- Lighthouse performance audits
- Optimized rendering with proper React patterns
- CSS animations with GPU acceleration
- Efficient state management

## Benefits of This Stack

This tech stack is cost-effective and allows future growth:

1. **Offline Capability**: By using web standards, the app "works offline and in the background" when needed
2. **Cost Efficiency**: PWAs are more cost-effective and have broader platform compatibility than native apps
3. **Future Extensibility**: Building with components and a service worker ensures we can later add features without redoing the foundation
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time checking to catch errors early
5. **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on various devices

## Future Considerations

- **Backend Integration**: If needed, the app could be connected to Walmart's backend systems for real-time data
- **Authentication**: User authentication could be added if access control becomes a requirement
- **Push Notifications**: Service workers could be used to enable push notifications for important updates
- **Offline Sync**: Implementation of offline data synchronization for when network connectivity is restored
